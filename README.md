# Infant-Mortality-Analysis

In this project we hope to analyze infant mortality rates in a larger scale - across countries of the world. Our three main external factors that we hypothesize are correlated to IMR are water quality (measured through number of water deaths), nutritional deficiency (measured through prevalence of underweight), and overall pollution levels.

## findings

Water quality and nutritional deficiency are most definitely correlated to each other and are a good measure of quality of life and even the IMR
Investing in the improvement of these issues will help lower IMR

Pollution is not as accurate of a determinant for quality life and IMR. This claim does not completely disprove the fact that high pollution could be a factor that affect IMR, but is rather a case by case basis

Our data strongly suggests that acts like the Maternal Health Momnibus Act in America and other public health programs across the world which combat issues like water quality and nutritional deficiencies could lower IMR and increase the number of happy and healthy mothers and infants.
